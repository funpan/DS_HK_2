##itle: A few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning
##By Pedro Domingos

##Abstract
Machine learning is widely used to perform important tasks such as prediction by generalising from examples. However, developing successful machine learning applications requires a large amount of so called “black art” that are mainly come from trials and errors instead of finding it from the text books. In this article, it summaries twelve key lessons learned by machine learning researchers and practitioners, including pitfalls to avoid, important issues to focus on, and answers to common questions.

##Style
This paper is mainly written for the current machine learning researchers and practitioners who familiar of machine learning algorithms and developments. In each lessons learned, the author briefly describes his points and arguments to the problem in machine learning, detail and background information are referring to the References section.

##Methods
Excluding the Introduction and conclusion, the twelve key lessons learned are clearly defined in same no. of subsections in the article. Moreover title of each sub-section is clear enough to the point without confusion.

##Conclusions
According to the target audience of this article is for the experienced machine learning researchers and practitioners, as a rookie of machine learning field, it certainly finds this article too concise and trying hard to acquire enough background knowledge and experiences in order to enjoy this article. 
However, one of a topic is impressive to the readers, it is Section 10 “Learn Many Models, Not Just one”.
In section 10, the author suggests of combining many variations of learners to generated a final result instead of just select the best variation. In real world, he introduces the Netflix prizes, teams competed to build the best video recommender system. It is found by the competing teams that they obtained the best results by combining their learners with other teams’, and merged into larger and lager teams. The winner finally stacked ensembles of over 100 learners and combining the runner up’s to further improved the results.
